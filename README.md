# Motion Detection with OpenCV

This project implements a real-time motion detection system using OpenCV in Python. The program captures video input from a webcam, detects motion by analyzing frame differences, and highlights motion events with visual and audio cues.

## Features

- **Real-Time Motion Detection**: Detects motion in video frames using background subtraction and frame differences.
- **Audio Alert**: Plays a sound when motion is detected.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Red blinking screen on motion detection.
  - Displays real-time motion statistics including pixel count and standard deviation.
  - Current date and time overlay on the video feed.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust motion sensitivity by tuning pixel count thresholds.
