Requirements

Python 3.x

Required libraries:

opencv-python

numpy

playsound

twilio

Webcam for capturing video input.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motion-detection-opencv-twilio.git
cd motion-detection-opencv-twilio

Install the required Python packages:

pip install opencv-python numpy playsound twilio

Place a valid .wav sound file named motion_detected_sound.wav in the project directory for the audio alert.

Set up your Twilio account and configure the credentials in the script:

Replace account_sid and auth_token with your Twilio credentials.

Update the twilio_whatsapp_from and twilio_whatsapp_to variables with appropriate WhatsApp numbers.

Configuration

Motion Sensitivity:
Modify the motion threshold:

motion_threshold = 5000  # Adjust based on sensitivity needs

Twilio Credentials:
Update the account_sid, auth_token, twilio_whatsapp_from, and twilio_whatsapp_to variables with your Twilio account details.

Troubleshooting

Sound Playback Issues:

Ensure the .wav file exists in the correct directory.

Install alternative libraries like pygame if playsound doesn't work.

Twilio Configuration Errors:

Verify the account_sid and auth_token values.

Ensure the twilio_whatsapp_from number is registered with Twilio.

Low Sensitivity:

Decrease the motion_threshold value.

High Sensitivity:

Increase the motion_threshold value.
